Gio, praise be upon him, sucks

I'll attach one of my first program's for ECS 60 in here.
It's called timetest.
We were suppose to compare and contrast the different data structures,
on how they inserted and deleted some numbers.
Pay attention to how the program parses the input file.
ITS MAGIC YO!
